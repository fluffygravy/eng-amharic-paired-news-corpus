The campaign has called upon the ruling party not to instill fear among Ethiopians rather to inspire citizens to say 'no to unconstitutional fear' Befeqadu, a Global Voice Amharic Editor sharedthe following message which has become viral on Facebook:
<QUOTE>
FEAR is unconstitutional and evidence of the entrenched culture and history of gross human rights violations in our country.
Fear kills imagination and inhibits the potential to aspire and envision a better future.
Fear is limiting and discouraging.
Fear cripples the spirit and shatter ideas and ideals.
Freedom is allowing, Freedom inspires, Freedom is peaceful, Freedom tolerates, Freedom Loves, Freedom transcends, Freedom sustains.
They say without vision people perish.
EPRDF is driving the nation to perish by creating a wall of fear and denying our inherent right to freedom of speech and expression.
Save Ethiopia by Respecting and Demanding EPRDF to #RespectTheConstitution! ሕገ-መንግሥቱ ይከበር!
