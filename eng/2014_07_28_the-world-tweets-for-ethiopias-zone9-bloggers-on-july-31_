Join Global Voices bloggers for a worldwide, multilingual tweetathon in support of the ten bloggers and journalists facing terrorism charges in Ethiopia.
<P>
The Global Voices community and our network of allies are demanding justice for these men and women, all of whom have worked hard to expand spaces for social and political commentary in Ethiopia through blogging and journalism.
We believe their arrest is a violation of their universal right to free expression, and that the charges filed against them are unjust.
Learn more about their story and the campaign for their release at the Zone9 Trial Tracker blog.
<P>
The bloggers' trial begins on August 4, 2014.
Until then, and beyond, they will need all the support they can get.
So this Thursday, we as a global community of bloggers, writers, activists, and social media experts will share this message around the world, tweeting in our native languages at community leaders, government and diplomatic officials, and mainstream media to draw public attention to the case.
