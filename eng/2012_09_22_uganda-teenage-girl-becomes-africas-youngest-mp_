Uganda: Teenage Girl Becomes Africa's Youngest MP &middot; Global Voices
</TITLE>
Proscovia Alengot Oromait has become Africa's youngest Member of Paliament (MP) at the age of 19, after she won the Usuk county election with 11,059 votes.
The outspoken youngster replaces her father who died earlier this year.
<P>
Alengot is a member of National Resistance Movement, headed by President Yoweri Museveni.
Other people who stood for the post included, Charles Ojok Oleny with 5,329 votes, Charles Okure from FDC with 2,725 votes and Cecilia Anyakoit of UPC with 554 votes.

Honourable Alengot Oromait.

Many people have come out to congratulate her, whilst some are saying she will not survive her term in parliament because of her age and limited experience.
Some people believe this is the beginning of change in Africa and its time to get rid of the overly old leaders and allow young people to take the continent forward.
<P>
Hon. Alengot's area faces challenges of clean water, electricity and poor roads among others.
For now the people of Usuk have their hopes pinned on the 19 year-old MP.
Hopefully, she will be in position to represent her area and develop it.

Joy Doreen Biira requests someone to teach Ms Alomait the basics she needs to learn as an MP:
<QUOTE>
@JoyDoreenBiira: Alengot Oromait, 19 years old is now a MP in Uganda....
Very Good.
But can someone "home-school" her on the basics she needs to know else...

Commenting on a story on the Monitor website, nkuutu urges advises the MP to concentrate on her studies, as the MP seat can be lost at anytime and she may have to look for a job:
<QUOTE>
<P>
I just have one piece of advice for the hon MP: Don't worry, be happy.
This might be the only time in your life to shine!
Come next elections ....who knows.
Don't forget your day job ...I mean your studies.
No one will give you a job with a CV with "ex-MP but no qualification".
Anyone can be an MP, but not everyone is educated.
<P>
Congrats!!

ProWoman thinks people are treating Ms Alengot like a baby.
She goes on to tell them to let her think for herself because she is an adult:
<QUOTE>
Proscovia does not need too much advice.
You guys are treating her like a baby.
At 19 she's an adult.
Schooling began at home.
Why is every man trying to be a parent to her?
Leave this young woman alone to think critically for herself.
It seems that there are too many cooks around.
Proscovia actually has the figure of Michelle Obama.
Tall, athletic, beautiful and confident.
Michelle the first Black US first lady did not need too much advice on how to be a first Black first lady in the White House.
Congratulations to Proscovia!
