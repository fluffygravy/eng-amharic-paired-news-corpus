Ethiopians Mock National TV's 'Lies' for April Fools’ Day &middot; Global Voices
</TITLE>
Ethiopians marked April Fools’ Day on Twitter with a steady stream of fake news headlines that imitated the "lies" of state-owned Ethiopian Television (ETv), the only national TV station in the African country.
Using the hashtag #ETvDay, netizens accused ETv of "telling lies 365 days".

The disputed 2005 Ethiopian election ended in street protests, with 193 people killed and more that 30,000 people detained by security forces.
In 2010, the election ended in a landslide victory for the incumbent Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, taking 99.6 percent of parliamentary seats.
The opposition rejected the results and international observers said the election fell short of international standards.
