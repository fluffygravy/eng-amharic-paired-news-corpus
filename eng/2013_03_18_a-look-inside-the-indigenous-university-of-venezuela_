A Look Inside the Indigenous University of Venezuela &middot; Global Voices
</TITLE>
What is it like to be a student at the Indigenous University of Venezuela ?
Three students from the department of edu-communication recently took part in a workshop led by Rising Voices in order to learn how to take better digital photographs and how to upload and share them on the internet
<P>
These three students are part of an effort to showcase this unique university designed to provide an intercultural and experimental form of education to students from Venezuela's indigenous communities.
By accessing the university's satellite connection, which was provided by the government program called Infocentros , the students are able to access the internet to share images of activities, facilities, and the stunning nature that surrounds the 2,000-hectare campus located in the state of Bolívar.
<P>
To read more about the university and the workshop held in February 2013, please read the post on the Rising Voices blog.

These are some of the photographs taken by the students and uploaded to the university's Flickr account.
