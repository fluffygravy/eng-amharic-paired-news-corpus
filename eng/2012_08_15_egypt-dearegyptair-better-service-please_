#DearEgyptAir, Better Service Please &middot; Global Voices
</TITLE>
Over the past few years it has become apparent that, if one has a loud enough voice and a big enough audience — not to mention a good sense of humor — social media can serve as a great platform for change.
And while that often means political or social change, it can also mean — as famous blogger Heather Armstrong, aka Dooce, has proven — the ability to get a major company to listen to your complaints.
<P>
Fed up with EgyptAir's service, English-Egyptian writer Amy Mowafi took to Twitter early Wednesday morning to gripe about her experience booking with the airline:
<QUOTE>
It has LITERALLY taken me an HOUR to bloody book my ticket @flyegyptair on the phone #FML
</QUOTE>
Adding a hashtag, Mowafi encouraged followers to tweet their own complaints about the airline:
<QUOTE>
To all those who've been tortured by @flyegyptair please join me in my plight to get them to answer and explain themselves #DearEgyptAir
</QUOTE>
Many quickly followed suit.
Waleed Mowafi (@WallyMow) added:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir Sometimes when i'm at home I rub sandpaper on my arms because i miss the feel of the Egypt Air blankets @flyegyptair
</QUOTE>
Mai Eldib (@14inchHEELS) complained:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir would it be possible for me to once fly without having pilots smoking in the cockpit @AmyMowafi
</QUOTE>
@Mayounah had a more pressing concern:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir plz don't roll your eyes at me when I complain water is dripping from your ac on board...I'm pretty sure it is an issue
</QUOTE>
Many were focused on the culinary "delights" offered by the airline. @ShadenFawaz said of the cake:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir have you tried eating that "cake" that you serve!?
Well it's not food in case you haven't noticed
</QUOTE>
@LailaShentenawi quipped:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir U make sure no one boards with a nail file!
Yet u ignore that if someone got hit with the bread u serve he/she could die!
</QUOTE>
Waleed Mowafi mocked:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir I think you guys are pushing culinary boundaries by creating a fish, chicken &amp; meat dish that all taste the same @flyegyptair
</QUOTE>
@MarwaAyad was a little more straightforward:
<QUOTE>
#DearEgyptAir Who prepares and cooks those meals?
Seriously who?
