Bahrain: Can Democracy and Islam Co-Exist? &middot; Global Voices
</TITLE>
Can democracy exist in Islamic societies?
This was the topic of conversation between Bahraini bloggers today.
<P>
Bahraini artist Al Shaikh raised the issue when he tweeted :
<QUOTE>
@Anas_Al_Shaikh: It is difficult to separate between what is political and what is religious in Islamic societies and this is why democracy will never succeed even if we write the best constitutions and accept the peaceful rotation of power
<P>
</QUOTE>
Fearless Ba7rainia replies:
<QUOTE>
@fearlessbahrain: Democracy is the solution and the remedy for such problems.
If laws are developed, people will improve too in a natural way.
A civil society is our people's savior
<P>
</QUOTE>
Bahraini journalist Abbas Busafwan has another take.
He responds to Al Shaikh's original tweet saying:
<QUOTE>
@abbasbusafwan: This conclusion is really painful.
It could be a generalisation.
Perhaps Turkey's example is a success
</QUOTE>
Al Shaikh answers:
<QUOTE>
@Anas_Al_Shaikh: Turkey did not balance between religious and political issues.
For instance, Turkey has rights for gays, and I saw them myself protesting on the famous Taksim street
</QUOTE>
And Ahmed Al-haddad adds:
<QUOTE>
@DiabloHaddad: Turkey isn't today what it was during the rule of Ataturk.
The famous Erdogan took Turkey to the pre-Ataturk era
</QUOTE>
In reply, Busafwan jokes:
<QUOTE>
@abbasbusafwan: I think that Saudi Arabia is the best example of democracy, Shura, Human rights, free Press, and balancing between religion and politics
</QUOTE>
Abu Yousif agrees that politics and religion don't mix:
<QUOTE>
@xronos2: I agree.
We shouldn't mix religion with politics for they don't agree and then we would become a repressive regime like Iran
</QUOTE>
And Abu Karim says we should improve what we already have instead of importing a Western-style democracy:
<QUOTE>
@AbuKarim1: Our problem is that we want to implement Western theories on our societies instead of searching in what we have and modernising it
