# eng-amharic-paired-news-corpus
Filtered and sorted by date, a split set identified 58 articles written in both Amharic and English, out of 23,000 english articles within the globalvoices.org project. 56 out of the 58 articles written in Amharic were written by bilingual translators. Two of those 58 were omitted because they were not translated verbatim, and Google Translate rendered the translations clearly unreliable.

Sorted by date of publication, the articles in both folders match up perfectly with one another. Perhaps renaming them in order to firmly establish this would be useful, but in the long run a simple data structure should fulfill the same purpose.
